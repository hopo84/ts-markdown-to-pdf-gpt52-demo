- Plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- Fabricated citations or data
- Confident assertions without proper grounding

**Solutions**:

**A. Enable Fact-Checking Mode**
```
"Before answering, activate web search to verify all factual claims. Cite 
sources for statistics and data points. If information cannot be verified, 
explicitly state 'This information could not be independently confirmed.'"
```

**B. Request Confidence Levels**
```
"For each factual claim, indicate your confidence level (High/Medium/Low) 
and reasoning. For Low confidence items, note what verification would be needed."
```

**C. Use Structured Verification**
```
"Provide your answer, then create a 'Fact-Check' section reviewing each 
claim against reliable sources. Flag any statements that could not be 
verified."
```

**D. Demand Source Attribution**
```
"Include inline citations [1], [2], etc. for all factual statements. Provide 
a references section with URLs or publication details."
```

**Issue 2: Overly Generic or Vague Responses**

**Symptoms**:
- Superficial treatment of complex topics
- Lack of specific examples or data
- Generic advice applicable to any situation

**Solutions**:

**A. Increase Specificity in Prompts**

❌ Generic: "How can I improve my website?"

✓ Specific:
```
"Analyze my e-commerce website (www.example.com) and provide specific 
improvements for:
1. Homepage conversion rate (currently 2.1%)
2. Mobile user experience (current bounce rate: 68%)
3. Product page SEO (ranking on page 3 for target keywords)

Include specific technical implementations, expected impact, and 
prioritization based on ROI."
```

**B. Request Concrete Examples**
```
"Don't just explain the concept—provide 3 real-world examples from 
recognizable companies, including specific metrics and outcomes."
```

**C. Demand Quantification**
```
"Include specific numbers, percentages, timeframes, and measurable outcomes 
for all recommendations. Avoid qualitative-only descriptions."
```

**Issue 3: Inconsistent Formatting or Structure**

### Subsection 1.1
[Content]
### Subsection 1.2
[Content]

## Section 2: [Name]
[Continue pattern]

## Conclusion
[2 paragraphs]

## References
[Numbered list]

Do not deviate from this structure."
```

**B. Request Progressive Disclosure**
```
"First, show me the complete outline with all section headings. Wait for 
my approval before writing any content."
```

3. Expected output
4. Common error scenarios and handling
5. Instructions for running and testing"
```

**C. Incremental Development**
```
"Build this application incrementally:
1. First, create minimal working version
2. Test and verify it works
3. Add next feature
4. Test again
5. Continue until complete

Show output at each step for validation."
```

**Issue 5: Response Truncation or Incompleteness**

**Symptoms**:
- Abrupt endings
- Missing conclusions
- Incomplete lists or examples

**Solutions**:

**A. Segment Large Requests**
```
"This will be a long response. After each major section, pause and ask if 
you should continue to the next section. This ensures nothing gets cut off."
```

**B. Request Continuation Explicitly**
```
When truncated: "Continue from where you stopped. Begin with the exact 
text that was cut off."
```

**C. Use Section-by-Section Approach**
```
"Let's build this in parts. First, complete only the Introduction section 
fully. When I confirm it's complete, move to the next section."
```

**Diagnostic Workflow for Poor Outputs**

When receiving unsatisfactory results:

```
Step 1: Analyze the Gap
"The previous response didn't meet my needs because [specific issues]. 
Before trying again, tell me what additional information or clarification 
would help you provide a better response."

Step 2: Refine the Prompt
[Incorporate GPT-5.2's suggestions and add more specificity]

Step 3: Request Self-Evaluation
"After providing your response, evaluate it against these criteria:
- Completeness (1-10)
- Specificity (1-10)
- Actionability (1-10)
Identify areas for improvement."

Step 4: Iterate
"Based on your self-evaluation, provide an improved version addressing 
the identified weaknesses."
```

### 5.2 Ethical Best Practices and Security Tips

Responsible AI usage requires vigilance regarding data privacy, bias mitigation, and security considerations.

**Data Privacy and Security**

**Best Practice 1: Data Minimization**

❌ Don't:
```
"Analyze this customer database: [paste entire database with PII]"
```
